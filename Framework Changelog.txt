Note: Changes marked with a * mean something you need to implement in the game specific components of the disassembly, if upgrading a disassembly to a new framework version.
Changes to the global components can just be handled by downloading the new framework version.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(2/13/2025 V1.4.0 release)
- *Updated the framework to use asar 1.91.
- *Increased the amount of errors asar will print out from 20 to 200 during main ROM assembly.
- If an invalid !FileType is given in the assembly script, asar will now display it in the error message.
- *Changed the naming convention of some defines.
	+ !Define -> !Const (if the define is acting as a constant)
- Removed the warning for ignoring code alignment and instead made the setting's state be printed out during assembly.
- Initialized the memory map of SPC700 code compilation to "norom".
- Updated the provided Lunar Compress files to version 1.90.
- Fixed a minor oversight in SetupSampleBankTable.asm, where the asset extraction file names would contain .bin instead of .brr.
- Made it so you can easily set the initial sample ID in SetupSampleBankTable.asm in cases where you're extracting multiple sample banks from a ROM.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(7/7/2023 V1.3.1 release)
- Added support for the Multiplayer 5 peripheral
- *Made it so that a disassembly will not assemble unless the asset extraction script has been run first.
- *The disassembly folder name is no longer tied to the GameID.
- *Attempting to assemble a valid, but unsupported ROM version now displays a message instead of giving a deluge of error messages.
- *Added a line of dashes in the command window when assembling a ROM or extracting assets to visually separate the input text with the text pertaining to the assembly/extraction itself.
- During asset extraction, a pointer value of $000001 should now correspond to a .tpl palette file, $000002-$0000FF correspond to game specific files, and $000100+ corresponds to an RDC file.
- *You can now specify the asar.exe used for asset extraction.
- *Moved "Bank of Defines.txt" and "Half Bank Of Defines.txt" to the Extras folder, since those have nothing to do with the global functionality of the framework.
- *Added opcode length specifiers to opcodes disassembled with SPC700ASMDis.asm.
- Fixed an oversight where SPC700 opcode 0x0A "OR1 C, $0000" in SPC700ASMDis.asm always disassembled with a 1 in the opcode.
- Fixed an oversight where SPC700 opcode 0xDF "DAA A" in SPC700ASMDis.asm was missing the single A.
- Added the batch script DisassembleASM.bat to the Extras folder to provide an easier way to use the various disassembly scripts that also outputs the code to a separate file instead of the command line.
- Increased the default number of bytes disassembled in the various disassembly scripts to cover a full lorom bank (except SPC700ASMDis.asm, which is set to half a lorom bank due to SPC700 engines not typically being very large)
- Removed the "<File> is too small!" error from %SetNextPreCompiledCodePointer() due to being redundant when the precompiled file fails to assemble from compiler errors.
- %ReadPreCompiledFilePointers() now defaults to initializing its defines to 0 to prevent redundant errors when the file it's reading from failed to compile.
- Added a check in the extraction script to prevent the script from crashing if AssetPointersAndFiles.asm contains a compilation error.
- MVN//MVP parameters now disassemble as "$YY0000>>16,$XX0000>>16" instead of "$YY,$XX" in SNESASMDis.asm.
- Added a blank disassembly script to the Extras folder, which can be used as a base for a custom disassembly script.
- The readword() and readlong() macros in SNESASMDis.asm/SPC700ASMDis.asm now require specifying a variable, much like readbyte() already did.
- Fixed a bug in the various disassembly scripts where !CurrentOffset wasn't initialized correctly, which could prevent a label from generating at the start of a code block.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(1/7/2023 V1.3.0 release)
- Created a new file format called "ROM Data Collection", which allows for related files to be extracted and compiled into a single file.
- SetupSampleBankTable.asm can now handle the last sample pointer and now sets up the file name data for the extraction script.
- Added a new section to the framework readme on Asset Extraction and the RDC file format.
- Assembling a ROM now shows whether default patches will be applied or not.
- *Removed the %StripeImageHeader() global macro as that's a remnant of this framework starting as a SMW disassembly and SMW and SMAS are the only games I've looked at that use stripe images.
- *Heavily altered how SPC700 and SuperFX code/data is meant to be handled by the framework. 
- *Removed the %SPCDataBlockStart(), %SPCDataBlockEnd(), %EndSPCUploadAndJumpToEngine() SPC700 specific macro, since not every game handles SPC700 uploads the same. 
- *%SPCDataBlockStart() and %SPCDataBlockEnd now function more like how %SuperFXBankStart() and %SuperFXBankEnd() function. They've also been renamed to %SPC700DataBlockStart() and %SPC700DataBlockEnd()
- *%SetNextPreCompiledCodePointer() now require specifying an index for what part of a pre-compiled file to reference.
- *%InsertNextPreCompiledCodeBlock() has been replaced with %ReadPreCompiledFilePointers()
- Added %MSU1RoutinePointer(), which is the pointer generation macro for MSU-1 files.
- Added a disassembly script for NES games to the Extras folder.
- Added new defines for SPC700 related registers.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(10/31/2021 V1.2.0 release)
- Added a memory map for Satelliview games.
- Added hardware register defines for Satelliview registers.
- Added a memory map define for custom memory maps, although this feature is not fully supported

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(9/20/2021 V1.1.3 release)
- *Added a new feature for applying default patches after main assembly. This is specifically for stuff like calculating checksums of copy detection routines that can't be done during main assembly.
- *Added a define that enables whether default patches are applied.
- Added the unused DMA registers to the DMA struct.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(8/14/2021 V1.1.2 release)
- %InsertMacroAtXPosition() now correctly accounts for when ROM Mirroring is in effect, when used during SNES ASM assembly.
- Added two new scripts to the Extras Folder that simplify setting up asset extraction data and relative pointer tables.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(6/9/2021 V1.1.1 release)
- Fix an oversight where the %GetROMSize() call in %CalculateFreespaceRemaining() was missing the parenthesis, breaking the asar patch applying feature.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(5/8/21 V1.1.0 release)
- Fixed !SA1_BWRAMWriteProtection_Disable being the wrong value.
- Changed the SRAM Bank for the SuperFX memory map to $700000
- Made the code that prints the checksum handle leading zeros using asar 1.80's improved hex() command function.
- *Can now specify two ROM sizes in order to be able to handle ROM sizes that aren't powers of 2, but rather the sum of 2 powers of 2 (ex. 1.5 MB).
- If the ROM size is set to be greater than 4 MB, the framework will auto set the ROM layout to ExLoROM, ExHiROM, or SA-1 LoROM based on the memory layout.
- *Removed the ExLoROM and ExHiROM defines, as those memory maps are now automatically assigned.
- *SRAM/BWRAM/ExRAM/IRAM Map files are now loaded in LoadGameSpecificMainSNESFiles() rather than GlobalAssemblySettings() in order to fix a bug with !SRAMBankBaseAddress not being initialized.
- *The LoadExtraRAMFile() macro now uses the !GameID as parameters, in order to determine whether a SRAM/BWRAM/ExRAM/IRAM Map file should be loaded.
- Tweaked the SuperFX, ExLoROM, and ExHIROM memory maps to better reflect the layout of those ROM maps.
- Memory map related data is now read during SuperFX code assembly.
- Added two new global macros InsertNextPreCompiledCodeBlock() and SetNextPreCompiledCodePointer(). These allow you to insert data that was compiled with a different tool besides asar. They function similarly to the SuperFX code macros.
- *Removed the SuperFX version of the above two macros.
- Added a new define !SRAMBankMirror/!EXRAMBankMirror/!BWRAMBankMirror that is intended to be ORed onto mirrored BW-RAM or SuperFX Expansion RAM. Which one to use depends on the current memory map.
- *The asset extraction scripts now expect different ROM versions to be named differently.
- Asar 1.81 is now the minimum asar version needed by the framework.
- The code disassembly scripts can now generate labels in the middle of code rather than only after opcodes that the CPU can't go past.
- *The %InsertVersionExclusiveFile() now uses an address parameter.
- %InsertMacroAtXPosition() now works during SPC700 or SuperFX code assembly. By extention, this also affects all global macros that accept an address parameter.
- %SetDuplicateOrNullPointer() now works during SPC700 or SuperFX code assembly.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(1/26/20) (V1.0.1 release)
- Upgraded to asar 1.81
- Adjusted the warning/error message for the incorrect version, as it displayed the disassembly version twice rather than the disassembly and framework version.
- Fixed a bugged assert error in the SuperFX global macros.
- Disabled the newly added warning for mapper switching.
- The %BANK_END macro now resets the !ROMBankSplitFlag flag.
- Fixed a bug where the !ROMBankSplitFlag was not accounted for with the %InsertMacroAtXPosition() macro.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(1/8/20) (V1.0.0 release)
- Added several global defines that define the start and end of the 2 RAM banks, the 8 KB mirror, and the SRAM/BW-RAM banks. Useful for RAM clear loops that use a general RAM address and not a specific one. The SRAM end one will adjust based on what SRAM/BW-RAM size and memory map is being used.
- Shortened the name of the !Joypad defines a little.
- Removed the old !Button defines and replaced them with the new !Joypad defines in all the games.
- Added the ability to set the byte that a FREE_BYTES macro will insert and the address it's supposed to be inserted at similar to a routine macro.
- Added SRAM map files. This includess all the SRAM defines being moved to them and adding defines that let one use a custom SRAM map.
- Renamed !Define_Global_GenerateHackedROM to !Define_Global_ApplyAsarPatches.
- It's no longer necessary to set !Define_Global_GenerateHackedROM to be able to link to custom files.
- Changed how ROM compilation works. You now have to type the GameID of the ROM you want to insert when running the .bat file.
- Replaced !UseExtendedHeader with !Define_Global_CartridgeHeaderVersion and added support for all 3 known cartridge header versions.
- The Licensee ID is now handled separately from the displayed name when assembling. The licensee name that gets displayed during assembly is now handled with a new define defined inside the ROM Map file.
- The output file's name will now change based on which ROM version is assembled. For example, assembling SMAS_U will give "Super Mario All-Stars (U)", assembling SMASW_E will give "Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World (E)", etc.
- The filename is now displayed instead of the GameID when assembling the ROM.
- Added disassembly framework version number defines, which will display the version of the framework during assembly. The disassembly framework version number is now displayed when assembling.
- Added support for 1.5 and 3.5 MB ROMs to the framework.
- The Misc. defines and macro file is now accessible when assembling an SPC700 related file.
- Added a small hack that will correct the checksum on unedited ROMs where asar doesn't output the same checksum as the original ROM. This applies only if !Define_Global_FixIncorrectChecksumHack is !TRUE and the output checksum matches with the one set by !Define_Global_AsarChecksum
- Made it so that asar will display leading zeros for checksums less than $1000.
- Added a new step to ROM compilation, specifically for checking the checksum and correcting it if the above mentioned hack is enabled.
- The checksum compliment can now be set independant of the checksum, specifically for ROMs where it was set wrong.
- Updated the GAMEX base ROM to include some functionality to aid with homebrew development, such as a general purpose V-Blank routine, a fade in/out function, initializing RAM and hardware registers, etc.
- Added a define !ContextDependentTable, which is meant for when a game directly indexes a table, but the table's address is highly variable. ie. LDA.w $0000,x, when the code is indexing ROM
- Added support for both versions of the DSP-1 chip. Technically, there are three versions, but DSP-1 and DSP-1A are identical codewise.
- Global macro ROMSettingWarningsAndErrors() has been renamed to PrintHeaderInformation(), and the various warning messages originally inside it have been moved to a new macro, DisplaySettingMessages(), which will display these warnings and the end of ROM assembly where they're better able to be seen. 
- Added new step to ROM compilation, specifically for copying firmware files into the disassembly folder when the current ROM is set to use a chip that requires it. Note that these firmware files are not provided by the disassembly and you must find them yourself! If you don't, asar will warn you if you attempt to use these chips.
- Added a check for if the bank parameter in the BANK_START() macro is greater than the max bank allowed by the ROM size or if it's greater than $FF.
- Added a warning if the ROM size is set to 32 KB and the memory map is set to one of the HiROM settings.
- Added in the DSP-1 defines to its hardware register file.
- Added ROMBANKXX_START/ROMBANKXX_END labels that auto generate for each BANK_START()/BANK_END() macro respecitively.
- Added a new global macro, HiROMBankSplit() that enables splitting a HiROM bank into two parts when using a HiROM memory map.
- Moved the bank defines from the Global_Definitions file to the memory map files, and adjusted them for each memory map. This fixes various checks in the BANK_START/END macros that previously didn't work and also allows the actual bank number to display when showing how much was inserted into each bank.
- Fixed a bug where asar would incorrectly insert a checksum at $C07FDC if assembling a HiROM game.
- Added partial support for the SuperFX memory map.
- Added a new global macro called InsertGarbageData(), which is used to insert blocks of garabge code/data from a disassembly's GarbageData folder. Blocks handled with this macro will be removed if !Define_Global_IgnoreOriginalFreespace is set to !TRUE. You can also set the address it inserts at like a routine macro.
- Added defines for the remaining SNES registers that needed them in the SNES hardware register file.
- Added partial support for the Super Gameboy and Satellaview.
- Added partial support for all of the more exotic controllers and related accessories.
- Removed the Assembly_Settings files and moved all their settings to the ROM Map files.
- Added defines to the ROM Map file for displaying the developer name, release date and MD5 Hash of the ROM that was used to make the disassembly.
- Added an optional compilation step to generate a save file
- Re-enabled the freespace leak warning for the Finalize ROM step of compilation.
- Disabled the warning about 16-bit parameters for some opcodes during SPC700 compilation. This is so labels can be used with these opcodes.
- Added a global macro called EnableSuperFXHiROMMirroring() that designates a bank as a HiROM bank when using the SuperFX memory map.
- Added some additional error checks regarding certain setting combinations, such as using certain chips without their respective memory map or using the SuperFX chip in conjunction with non-standard controllers.
- Added support for custom ROM Map files without the need for changing the base disassembly.
- Rewrote the readme entirely to be far more informative and up to date with all the new changes to the framework.
- Fixed a small bug where the ! after the "Done" that's displayed after ROM assembly has finished would not display.
- Reworked how SNES_Header() works it now accepts a 24-bit address as its parameter and it can now be used as many times as one wants. In addition, placing it overrides the automatic header insertion function.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(7/3/20)
- Added the ability to set which controllers are used by the game being assembled.
- Moved all the Memory Map files in the global folder to a subfolder.
- Changed how the cartridge header defines are loaded so that they are now loaded from the ROM Map file instead of the Assemble_Settings.asm file.
- Cleaned up the Assembly Setting files to remove the now redundant header defines.
- Removed the StoreHackedROMHeaderDefines() global macro as it's no longer needed.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(1/3/20)
- Added a new disassembly for "GAMEX", which can serve as a base for creating your own disassemblies and/or for homebrew development.
- Removed the various Custom_X_Game.asm files from the custom folders, as you can get the necesssary base files from the GAMEX folder.
- Corrected the spelling of assembly on the AssemblySetting files.
- Removed the Main_X.asm files, as I standardized all the games to use AssembleROM.asm as the base file.
- Removed the various unknown SPC data files from the various folders.
- Renamed the BASE_START/BASE_END global macros to SPCDataBlockStart/SPCDataBlockEnd and added some error checking to them.
- Added a new global macro called EndSPCUploadAndJumpToEngine that is used to mark an "end point" for SPC file uploads.
- Created defines for the SPC700/DSP, MSU-1, and S-RTC registers.
- Moved the hardware register defines to separate files so only the needed ones get loaded. The SNES/SPC700 ones are always loaded depending on what is being assembled.
- Added a new custom chip define that controls what custom chips are being used.
- Added partial support for the DSP-2, DSP-3, DSP-4, Cx4, S-RTC, S-DD1, SPC7110, ST010, ST011, and ST018. None of these have defines created for them.
- Added a 1 to the end of the !Chip_DSP define to avoid confusion with the DSP chip the SPC700 interacts with and the other DSP-X chips.
- Moved a lot of the fixed defines from Assembly_Settings_X.asm to Global_Definitions.asm. This was done to make it easier to add new defines when needed in order to reduce the number of files that need to be updated.
- Added support for the expanded cartridge header at $00FFB0.
- Added the ability to set it so that both the custom and the original RAM Map, Routine Macros, Macros, and Misc Defines file can be loaded.
- Standardized the RAM label defines to be !RAMType_Game_Tag_Name where "Tag" now indicates where the RAM address is used as opposed to its function. The function has been moved to the "Name" portion. However, this doesn't apply to SMAS and SMW as of yet.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(7/5/19)
- Modified the behavior of the SNES_Header to allow multiple to be inserted based on the mapper.
- Disabled warning W1019 to allow one to place manual RATS tags in the disassembly without asar nagging about how you should put @xkas somewhere.
- Wrote a couple macros for inserting RATS tags and added a toggle to disable these RATS tags from being inserted.
- Made the PrintLabelLocation display the ROM version.
- Reworked how the routine position hardcoding works, so instead of 2-7 defines being stored in every routine macro, the ROM address is stored in a macro parameter.
- Made it so that each version of each game has its own separate ROM Map file.
- Moved the game specific bank macros to the respective Routine Macros file.
- Added a new setting, !Define_Global_IgnoreOriginalFreespace, that lets one toggle whether the original game's freespace is inserted.
- Made asar display the state of the various !Define_Global_UseCustomX defines when generating a hacked ROM.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(1/8/19)
- Made it so that the SRAM will automatically remap itself based on the memory map.
- Added support for 256 KB of SRAM/BW-RAM.
- Added support for 2.5 MB ROMs, since that's the size SMAS+W is.
- Made asar display information about the current SNES header settings.
- Rewrote the bank handling system to fix the memory mapping for HiROM and SA-1 (though ExLoROM/ExHiROM don't work yet). In addition, setting the ROM size greater than 4 MB and the mapper to SA-1 will now make asar use fullsa1rom addressing.
- Added a bunch of error checks when setting the banks to reduce the chances of overwriting data that's already been inserted. Banks must now also be inserted in ascending order.
- Enabled the ability to use a custom version of ROM_Map_X.asm, RAM_Map_X.asm, Macros_X.asm, Routine_Macros_X.asm, and Misc_Defines_X.asm. You may also specify the path to the file so asar will know where to look.
- Added in some defines for various hardware registers
- Updated the readme because it was pretty out of date.
- Updated the included asar version to 1.71.
- Cleaned up the InitializeROMSettings macro to be more general purpose. The SMW/SMAS specific stuff has been offsourced to a game specific version of these macros.
- Moved the ROM setting stuff from Global_Definitions.asm to game specific AssemblySettings_X.asm files. This also means that one can have different settings between SMW and SMAS.
- Made it possible to easily change the unused Native/Emulation mode vectors in the cartridge header, just in case some chip happened to use them or the user wants to make use of these 8 bytes.
- When inserting a block of data that spans multiple banks, asar will now print out both the amount of bytes inserted and the bank range they were inserted at.
- Updated this changelog to divide it up into sections specific to each game and a general section for global changes. I also corrected the entry for (4/19/18) because I accidentally used the changelog for (4/16/19).
- Moved a couple files to a new Global folder to reduce clutter.
- Other miscellaneous changes.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(1/4/19)
- Added some SA-1 register defines to Global_Definitions.asm
- Updated the included asar version to 1.70 (released today!), which sped up compilation time by 12 seconds.
- Removed the GetRemainders and GetCorrectIncbinOffsets macros because they're now redundant due to the above change.
- Other minor tweaks.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(10/23/18)
- Added a warnpc check in SNES_Header so that an error is thrown if bank 00's contents go past $00FFC0/$80FFC0.
- Disabled the freespace leak warning (W1011) since the entire ROM is assembled at once, so freespace leaks can't occur.
- Added a register define for $213F, since I forgot to make one.
- Changed all the RAM defines from $0000-$1FFF to be for bank 00 instead of 7E, as that's how they're referenced when using long addressing. Also removed the comments mentioning this.
- Modified the BANK_START macro so that it works differently based on the memory map setting and the current bank.
- The !GameID define is now passed to asar through the command line, making it possible to assemble the ROM differently depending on which game the ROM is supposed to be.
- !Define_ROMToAssemble has been split into two defines, one for SMW when being assembled by itself and one for SMAS+W.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(10/1/18)
- Created a makefile for assembling the ROM.
- Removed the InsertSharedCodeOrDataMacros macro, since I created a better system for handling shared macros.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(9/13/18)
- Implemented the unused controller defines into the disassembly.
- Switched the order of the entries in the changelog so that the most recent version is first.
- Added the ability to set the ROM size to 128 KB, 64 KB, and 32 KB. Those aren't official SNES ROM sizes, but I don't see a reason why they wouldn't work.
- Added defines for each of the vectors located in the SNES header. This will make it easier to quickly change these.
- Created a macro for inserting patches after the ROM is assembled. This one is meant for patches that haven't been integrated into the disassembly or ones that don't work during ROM assembly (ex. Ones that use the readX commands).
- Made it so that each game's folder has its own asar_patches.asm and Patches folder.
- Moved all the WRAM/VRAM/CGRAM/SRAM defines and structs to a separate file.
- Many other small changes.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(8/20/18)
- Rearranged the folder structure of the disassembly to make this into a possible SMAS+W disassembly.
- Split up some files so that certain defines/macros can be shared among the other games in SMAS+W
- Added a batch script folder that will include useful batch scripts. The only one included so far is one that will give you the X/Y position of a stripe image for use with the StripeImageHeader macro.
- Added the ability to change the Licensee in the cartridge header.
- Changed the file extension of the assembled ROM to .sfc, so asar will assemble the ROM without the copier header.
- Fixed a bug where assembling the ROM as 4 MB would cause asar to throw an error.
- Added this changelog to the disassembly.
- Made it possible to easily change the asar executable to use when running Assemble_SMW.bat
- Made a slight change to the included asar 1.60 that prevents asar from automatically using FastROM addressing when using lorom addressing.
- Many other small changes.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(7/28/18)
- Updated the included asar version to the released version of 1.60.
- Added a macro that tells you the SNES address that a given label is located at. To use, place these macros at the end of main.asm and put the label name inside the parenthesis.
- Created a Custom folder inside the GFX folder. This is where you should put custom graphics data if you're planning on using this disassembly to make your hack.
- Removed the compression.bat from the non-Custom folders.

- Moved the debug defines to be inside Asar_Patches.asm.
- Created defines for every single sprite property that can be modified with Tweaker.
- Various other changes.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(7/5/18)
- Added a readme.
- Updated the included asar version to the latest 1.60 beta.
- Various small changes.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(6/19/18)
- Added an extra step to ROM compilation that shows the checksum of the generated ROM. In addition, if generating a non-custom ROM, asar will also display the original checksum as a comparison.
- Various other small changes.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(6/2/18)
- Added more defines for the cartridge header based on what the SNES Dev manual  specifies.
- Added an extra step to the ROM compilation that generates a blank ROM based on the size you selected it to be in the cartridge header. This is so that patches that use freespace will work correctly.
- Various small changes.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(4/24/18)
- Hardcoded SNES_Header to be inserted at $00FFC0, since moving that is a bad idea.
- Added a define that tells asar to ignore the org/warnpc statements in the InsertRoutine/InsertData macros and the FREE_BYTES macros. This is for advanced users who don't care about keeping SMW compatible with various tools.
- Code/data placed in banks $10-$7D/$80-$FF will now automatically get a RATS tag. You can turn this behavior off if desired.
- Other small, miscellaneous changes.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(4/7/18)
- Updated the included asar to the newest version.

;--------------------------------------------------------------------

(4/6/18)
- Initial release
